# ExtendScript Toolkit Debugger Fix
## What this does
This will implement a very rough fix to the error thrown by ExtendScript.

## How to run?
1. Open Terminal.
2. `cd` to the directory this script lives inside. If it can't be found try `find / -name 'fix_var.sh'` in terminal which should locate the script however may take some time to run.
3. Ensure all Adobe software is closed before running.
4. Run the script like so `./fix_var.sh {PATH}`, if it initially doesn't work try `chmod a+x fix_var.sh` this will only need to be done once per machine. The PATH argument is optional, only pass it if the script isn't in the default location of ENTER LOCATION HERE AND HOW TO VERIFY ITS LOCATION. The PATH argument can be either the absolute path or relative path of the file. (Absolute's easiest most likely).
